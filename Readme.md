According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen), lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship. 

Lychen is similar: a JavaScript interpreter ([V8](https://v8.dev)) in a command line C# application with C# objects, methods and properties made available to the JavaScript interpreter through [ClearScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/ClearScript).

It's called Lychen because the name Lichen has [already been taken](http://projects.boddie.org.uk/Lichen) for a Python-like language and toolchain.

This project was hosted on VisualStudio then BitBucket and now GitHub.
